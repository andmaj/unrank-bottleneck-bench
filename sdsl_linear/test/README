This is a set of tests for the succinct data structure library (sdsl).

You can compile the tests by calling 
`make` 
and execute them by calling 
`make test`
or
`make vtest`, if you would like to
call the test with valgrind.
.

In some test instances we generate data structures, e.g. 
compressed suffix trees,  for real world inputs. 
These inputs are downloaded with the command
`curl` from a ``Project Gutenberg'' mirror before the
first execution of the test.

The tests use google's gtest framework which should
be installed, since you have already executed
the `install.sh` bash script to install the sdsl
library.

If you find a bug, please report it to us. Thanks.
