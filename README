Unrank bottleneck benchmark
===========================

Benchmark unrank operation cost of access using libcds and sdsl library.

To make:
make

To test libcds:
make cds-bench

To test sdsl:
make sdsl-bench

Between tests:
make clear

Results (Intel Q6600):
a) Not a bottleneck in libcds (because using a lookup table)
b) Unrank takes 27-47 % of access time in sdsl.
