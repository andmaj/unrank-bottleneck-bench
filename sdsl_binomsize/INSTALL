The installation requires the cross-platoform
build-tool cmake to be installed first.

You can download cmake here:

http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

With cmake installed, the library then can be 
installed automatically by running the command
./install.sh YOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX

YOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX should be an absolute
path to an existing directory other then the 
directory where this INSTALL file is located in.

After running the script you can change into
the test directory and make and execute the tests by
make && make test

Check out also the examples directory. 

You can compile your own program example.cc by

g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -funroll-loops -I YOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX/include \
    -LYOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib -o example example.cc \
	-lsdsl -ldivsufsort -ldivsufsort64

or you can copy the Makefile from the examples directory
to build you programs using sdsl.
